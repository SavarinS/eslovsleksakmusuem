Project summary

I combine my interest in Headless CMS, REST API and design. The method I used in the project is ReactJs, WordPress, Boostrap and flexbox. ReactJs is used to build a new user interface and WordPress is only for store text and images. To display the content, I made a request with REST API and URL endpoint, which I got it from WordPress and I styled the website with Boostrap and flexbox.
