Project summary

I combine my interest in Headless CMS and design. The method I used in the project is ReactJs, WordPress, and flexbox. ReactJs is used to build a new user interface and WordPress is only for store text and images. To display the content, I made a request to URL endpoint, which I got it from WordPress and I styled the website with flexbox. The purpose of this project is that I deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and CSS. Moreover, I gain a basic knowledge of ReactJS.
	The website that I choose is a toy museum in Eslöv and I intend to use it as an exercise. Therefore, the website is uploaded on my server.
